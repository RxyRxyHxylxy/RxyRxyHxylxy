## üë®‚Äçüíª About me:
I'm currently looking for a chance to start professionally in the QA industry. My previous experiences have been as a Customer Service Representative for different companies, but I took a break to focus on studying to get a job I could be more passionate about. </br>
Recently, I graduated from college with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in computer systems engineering; and I decided to specialize as a Quality Analyst, so I did a QA Engineering Bootcamp as well, which I also concluded already. </br> </br>
My driving forces are: </br>
‚¶æ Excel at anything I do! </br>
‚¶æ Learning new things. </br>
‚¶æ Technology. </br>
‚¶æ Fine Arts. </br>
‚¶æ Videogames. </br>
‚¶æ Languages. </br>
‚¶æ Trying Worldwide Cuisine. </br>
