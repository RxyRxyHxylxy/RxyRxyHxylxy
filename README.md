## üë®‚Äçüíª About me:
I'm currently looking for a chance to start professionally in the QA industry. I took a break from working to focus on studying, so I could get a job that I could be more passionate about. Recently, I graduated from college with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in computer systems engineering; and decided to specialize as a Quality Analyst, so I enrolled on a QA Engineering Bootcamp, which I also concluded as well. </br></br>
I enjoy developing code in order to execute test cases, and verifying that the app's features are working correctly; since I've had bad experiences with apps in the past myself, and I really value the customers' satisfaction since I've previously worked as a Customer Service Representative.</br> </br>
My driving forces are: </br>
‚¶æ Excel at anything I do! </br>
‚¶æ Learning new things. </br>
‚¶æ Technology. </br>
‚¶æ Fine Arts. </br>
‚¶æ Videogames. </br>
‚¶æ Languages. </br>
‚¶æ Trying Worldwide Cuisine. </br>
