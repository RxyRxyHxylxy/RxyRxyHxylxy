I'm currently looking for a chance to start professionally in the QA industry, since my previous experiences have been as a Customer Service Representative for different companies, but I took a break to focus on studying to get a job I could be more passionate about. 
Recently, I graduated from college with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer systems engineering; and I decided to specialize as a Quality Analyst, so I did a QA Engineering Bootcamp as well, which I also concluded already. My driving forces are: </br>
â—˜ Learning new things </br>
â—˜ Technology </br>
â—˜ Worldwide Cuisine </br>
â—˜ Fine Arts </br>
â—˜ Videogames </br>
