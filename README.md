# Welcome, my name is Raymundo Garcia.
### I'm an aspiring QA Engineer, with a bachelor's degree in computer systems engineering.

I am currently looking for a chance to start professionally in the QA industry, since my previous experiences have been as a Customer Service Representative for different companies, but I took a break to focus on studying to get a job I could be more passionate about. 
Recently, I graduated from college with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer systems engineering; and I decided to specialize as a Quality Analyst, so I did a QA Engineering Bootcamp as well, which I also concluded already.
