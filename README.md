### I'm an aspiring QA Engineer, with a bachelor's degree in computer systems engineering.
![Header](./header.jpg)

I'm currently looking for a chance to start professionally in the QA industry, since my previous experiences have been as a Customer Service Representative for different companies, but I took a break to focus on studying to get a job I could be more passionate about. </br>
Recently, I graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree in computer systems engineering; and I decided to specialize as a Quality Analyst, so I did a QA Engineering Bootcamp as well, which I also concluded already. </br> </br>
My driving forces are: </br>
⦾ Excel at anything I do! </br>
⦾ Learning new things. </br>
⦾ Technology. </br>
⦾ Fine Arts. </br>
⦾ Videogames. </br>
⦾ Languages. </br>
⦾ Trying Worldwide Cuisine. </br>
